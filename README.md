Notesdot

React/Redux/Firebase

Demo - https://notesdot.herokuapp.com/

My first independent React/Redux application.

Authorization and db done with Firebase.
Each user can create and use multiple boards which are displayed on the main page. 
Clicking on specific board redirects to board page containing moveable sticky notes.
To create a new note drag notes stack outside of it's initial area. 
Color of the notes can be adjusted by picking color either in notes stack or by editing an individual note.

To do's:
- find better way to style componends (maybe styled components or scss?)
- finish styling remaining elements + proceed with files split
