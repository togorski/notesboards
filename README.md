Notesdot

React/Redux/Firebase

Demo - https://notesdot.herokuapp.com/

My first independent React/Redux application.

Authorization and db done with Firebase.
Each user can create multiple boards which are displayed on the main page. 
Clicking on specific board redirects to board page containing moveable sticky notes.
To create a new one drag notes stack outside of it's initial area. 
The color can be adjusted by picking color either in notes stack or by editing an individual note.

To do's:
- find better way to style components (maybe styled components or scss?)
- finish styling remaining elements + proceed with files split
- fix bug - when resizing note through left border it changes position
